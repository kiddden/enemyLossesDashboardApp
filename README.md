## Important Notices
- Estimated amount of wounded(including lost) is calculated as personnel losses multiplied by 3. 
3 wounded per 1 killed is known as the average killed\wounded ratio in most modern conflicts. However, this number is still not accurate.
- Total human losses are calculated as (personnel loses * pow * wounded). Considering the fact that one variable in this equation is not accurate the total human losses indicator is very approximate as well.
